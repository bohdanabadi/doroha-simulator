# Doroha-Simulator

## Introduction or Overview
The Doroha-Simulator is a dynamic car/journey simulation project that visualizes the movement of vehicles from one point to another across a segment of Kyiv's map. It uniquely integrates the display of system metrics alongside the simulation, offering an insight into the application's performance in real-time. The entire process is automated, with no user input required, showcasing a blend of engineering and creative visualization.

## Motivation
This project was embarked upon as a personal endeavor to enhance my engineering skills and to tackle the challenges I've encountered with traditional data structures and algorithm-style interviews. Inspired by a blog from the programmatic engineer, and driven by my own experiences, the Doroha-Simulator represents a step forward in my journey as a developer, merging practical application with continuous learning.

## Technologies Used
The Doroha-Simulator is built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies:
- **Backend**: Go (using Gin for HTTP routing, OpenAPI for API specification, and gorm for ORM..etc)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling, Leaflet for map interaction..etc
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (PostGIS) for data persistence
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for system monitoring
- **Web Server**: NginX as a reverse proxy and for serving content
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating isolated environments

## Challenges Encountered & Learning Outcomes
Throughout the development of the Doroha-Simulator, I encountered numerous challenges, particularly in understanding the extensive domain of maps and implementing algorithms for pathfinding and movement simulation. The project demanded a high level of organization and planning, from which I've learned the importance of pre-development work and the value of comprehensive understanding over trial and error. These experiences have greatly contributed to my growth as an engineer, enhancing both my technical skills and my approach to problem-solving.
