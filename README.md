# Doroha-Simulator

## Introduction or Overview
The Doroha-Simulator is a dynamic car/journey simulation project that visualizes the movement of vehicles from one point to another across a segment of Kyiv's map. It uniquely integrates the display of system metrics alongside the simulation, offering an insight into the application's performance in real-time. The entire process is automated, with no user input required, showcasing a blend of engineering and creative visualization.

## Motivation
This project was embarked upon as a personal endeavor to enhance my engineering skills and to tackle the challenges I've encountered with traditional data structures and algorithm-style interviews. Inspired by a blog from the [pragmatic engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/an-educational-side-project/), and driven by my own experiences, the Doroha-Simulator represents a step forward in my journey as a developer, merging practical application with continuous learning.

## Technologies Used
The Doroha-Simulator is built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies:
- **Backend**: Go (using Gin for HTTP routing, OpenAPI for API specification, and gorm for ORM..etc)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling, Leaflet for map interaction..etc
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (PostGIS) for data persistence
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for system monitoring
- **Web Server**: NginX as a reverse proxy and for serving content
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating isolated environments

## Challenges Encountered & Learning Outcomes
Throughout the project's development, I encountered numerous hurdles.
These included facets of the software development cycle I hadn't delved into deeply before,
like deployment, frontend development, and server setup, among others.
I also immersed myself in domain-specific knowledge related to maps, such as pathfinding algorithms,
extracting map data, and simulating movement on a map.
Moreover,
I honed skills in organization
and familiarized myself with various tools and methodologies for planning and execution
before the development phase began.
These experiences have significantly enriched my engineering capabilities,
improving both my technical prowess and my problem-solving strategies.
